### enhanced things

The purpose of this blog is to distribute things that interest me and that I build.  You will find items in here ranging from Amateur Radio to Gunsmithing and Machining techniques and notes, even snippets of code for doing various things from system management to security and well beyond.  Suffice it to say, I sleep very little!
